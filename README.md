# 🧩 Multi-Step Form – React + CSS

Hi! 👋 I'm Prakhar, currently learning frontend development and sharing my progress as part of the **#BuildInPublic** movement. This project is a simple multi-step form built using **React and CSS**.

The goal? Practice core frontend skills like component state management, form validation, and user-friendly UX design — all by building something real.

## 🔍 What I Built

✅ Step-wise form navigation  
✅ Field-level validation with dynamic error messages  
✅ Date validation (only allows today or future dates)  
✅ Clean, minimal UI with CSS  
✅ Conditional rendering of steps

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React.js
- CSS
- useState + basic form logic

## 🎥 Demo

🎬 **[Coming soon]** – I’ll be uploading a screen recording here!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run it locally:
